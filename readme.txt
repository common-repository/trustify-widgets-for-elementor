= Optimize for Search Engines =

To improve your search engine visibility, add the Trustify Elementor component to the global footer or, preferably, to the footer of as many pages as possible. Select a footer style, as Trustify provides specific meta content in the footer styles according to schema.org guidelines or as required by search engines like Google. This will help enhance your ranking and make your score and stars appear in search results and your Google Business Card.


== Trustify API ==

This plugin uses the Trustify API to load content from Trustify profile pages and display it in the widgets. This [API url](https://api.trustify.ch/ "Trustify API") is used for this.
The API returns up to 50 ratings and profile information from a single Trustify profile. We create the API url resp. call with the Trustify Profile Slug you enter and make 2 calls. Once for your Trustify profile information and once for the rating feed.
More about the [Trustify API](https://docs.trustify.ch/ "Trustify API Documentation") you can find here and the associated terms and conditions and data protection also on our website.

Important: By using the plugin, Trustify does not receive any user data back. We only see how often our API is called up and the IP address of your web server.

== Public Libraries ==

* We use [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/ "Swiper website") for our mobile touch slider function. The used source code can be viewed here on [GitHub](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper "GitHub swiper").
